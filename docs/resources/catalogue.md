# Resource Catalogue [TODO]

> The purpose of this section is to identify the building-block, its role in the architecture, and its relationship to the other building-blocks expressed through the interfaces it provides and consumes. The idea is to provide a singular entrypoint to the EOEPCA building-blocks.<br>
> In the first instant, gather relevant information from existing docs/wikis where it exists, and collate here.<br>
> Use dedicated markdown files to separate the sub-section content if needed.<br>
> Use diagrams if useful.
> This section describes the Resource Catalogue building-block. The relationship of the Resource Catalogue to other components is described <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOEPCA/eoepca/v1.1/release-notes/release-description/reference-impl.png">here</a>
