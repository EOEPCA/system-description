# Resource Catalogue [TODO]

>The purpose of this section is to identify the building-block, its role in the architecture, and its relationship to the other building-blocks expressed through the interfaces it provides and consumes. The idea is to provide a singular entrypoint to the EOEPCA building-blocks.<br><br>
>This section describes the Resource Catalogue building-block. The relationship of the Resource Catalogue to other components is described in the <a href="../../system/overview/">System Overview</a>.


## Description

>The main Use Cases for the Resource Catalogue are described below.<br>
![EOEPCA Resource Catalogue Use Cases](../../img/resources/EOEPCA-Resource-Cat-Use-Cases.drawio.png "EOEPCA Resource Catalogue Use Cases")
>Use cases are
> * Publish Metadata.  This Metadata can be an input or output for the ADES ( Application Deployment & Execution Service).
>   * Publish Product. Metadata relating to a product and containing a reference to that product.
>   * Publish Processing Service. Metadata describing a Processing Service.
>   * Publish Interactive Application. Metadata describing the needs of an Application.
>   * Publish Collection.  Metadata describing a collection of Metadata.
> * Compliance. Metadata compliance required before it is published. 
> * Search Metadata.  Find desired Metadata.
>   * Search Temporally. Time based search. 
>   * Search by AOI. Area of Interest based search. 
>   * Search Input for Data Processing. Input required by a process in the ADES.
>   * Search Parameters for Processing. Parameters required to help configure a process in the ADES.
> * Authorisation. This may be requites to perform Publish and Search based Use Cases.


## Interfaces

> Specification of interfaces provided by the component.<br>
> Link to external specifications if applicable.

## Dependencies

> Describe links with other eoepca components - e.g. interfaces consumed.

## Additional Information

> Include descriptions of anything that is relevant to help users of the component.<br>
> Links to other relevant information.
