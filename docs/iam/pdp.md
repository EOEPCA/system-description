# PDP - Policy Decision Point

==[To be completed by Deimos]==

> The purpose of this section is to identify the building-block, its role in the architecture, and its relationship to the other building-blocks expressed through the interfaces it provides and consumes. The idea is to provide a singular entrypoint to the EOEPCA building-blocks.<br>
> In the first instant, gather relevant information from existing docs/wikis where it exists, and collate here.<br>
> Use dedicated markdown files to separate the sub-section content if needed.<br>
> Use diagrams where useful.

## Description

> Description to include:
> 
> * role in the architecture
> * functional capabilities

## Interfaces

> Specification of interfaces provided by the component.<br>
> Link to external specifications if applicable.
