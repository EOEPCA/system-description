# Application Package Validator [TODO]

==[To be completed by Terradue]==

> The purpose of this section is to describe the Application Package Validator, its usage and links to other relevant resources. The idea is to provide a singular documentation entrypoint, alongside the EOEPCA building-blocks.<br>
> In the first instant, gather relevant information from existing docs/wikis where it exists, and collate here.<br>
> Use dedicated markdown files to separate the sub-section content if needed.<br>
> Use diagrams where useful.
